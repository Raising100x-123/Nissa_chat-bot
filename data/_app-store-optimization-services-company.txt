Keyword Research for ASO

We apparently understand that both the iOS App Store and Google Play store have different approaches to ASO. We use various tools to understand the competitors you are targeting, keywords and languages your customers are searching for, and the ones that will drive the most traffic.

App Title

The most important part of App Store Optimization is, the App name or title, needs to be a balance between branding, uniqueness, and relevant keywords that drive search results. We recommend short titles, followed by a vertical bar or a dash, and select keywords for description.

App Description

An app’s description should have a call-to-action function as a - describing what your app does clearly, its features, its products/services, and compelling reasons to download it. Simple, compact, and updated app descriptions will drive downloads.

App Reviews & Ratings

The most important factor in app rankings is the quality of reviews and ratings. Encourage ratings and reviews from happy customers, either through incentives or prompts. We help analyze your existing reviews, increase the volume of ratings, and leverage feedback to improve ASO.

App Logo

An attention-grabbing beautiful logo in bright colors, unique shape, is a key part of your app’s branding.

App Screenshots

Including screenshots and videos allow potential users to visualize your mobile app and will drive downloads. Highlight the best parts of your mobile app, its most popular screens, and its key features!

App Category

In Apple’s App Store, you can pick a primary and secondary category for your app while in the Google Play Store, you can only pick one. Choosing a relevant category is extremely important to success - user mindset, and competitor categories are all valid considerations.

Download & Retention

Post download, app retention, and app engagement are the next challenges to work on a high-quality app. Introducing adding personalization, asking and acting on user feedback, as well as frequent updates to the app will be valuable additions to the lifecycle of the app.
